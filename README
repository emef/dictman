How to Customize the website
##############################################

NOTE: Do not edit any of the files located in the directory 'static' this
directory is automatically populated by the './manage collectstatic' command which
should be run after changes to javascript or css files.

The two css files are located at 'words/static/css/base.css' 
and 'words/static/css/word_list.css'

At the bottom of word_list.css are many css selectors labeled and commented with 
what they apply to. You should be able to fully customize the display by changing
these styles.
